### Our artifical best friends: animism in Robots (and other machines)

- Meta-Obeservation:
Most research o anthropomorphism in machinery focuses on *Social Robots* that are specificially designed to appear human- or lifelike.

- Anthropomorphic relationships to robots are influenced by framing
- ->Frame it the right way
Darling argues that anthropomorphic framing might enhance the functionality of the technology. This implies that the robot is ultimately still considered a tool whose anthropomorphic qualities contribute to its usefulness. 
- This is especially the case with robots that are speifically designed for "social tasks", particularly in situations where human-human communication is difficult
- anthropomorphized robots recieve more acceptance
- but emotional attachment is not always desirable
- social robots are non judgemental
- Reports that tolerance for malfunction is higher with Robots with lifelike qualities, even if it is just a name (-> because living beings make mistakes and we are subconsciously justifing them?). Darling argues that these properites might improve technology adoption and and literacy. 
- Adoption yes, but what obout literacy? (Adoption: using it, literacy: understanding whtas going on)

- lifelike robots, *along with mechanisms of gameification* are prone to be emotionally manipulative
- While this can be beneficial for come usecases, it certainly is also dangerous
- *technological literacy would also include the ability to willingly give into this manipulation or don't. The Keyword is ***Willing*** Suspension of disbelief*.

- Problem: You are interacting with a story / character someone else created, not with the real deal
-> your interations fall back on you

- Robots as the more ethical alternative to "real pets" for especially children: *Children are projecting somehting into pets that they are not anyways*, so robots can provide what a child wants from a pet without actually putting a living being at stake. Sma argumentaion for dementia patients
- therapy robots are not a replacement for human care, but an assisting tool. They provide a sense of emotional closesness that cannot be provided by medical personnel.

- People percieve robots as more competent when their expectations are lowered.

### Slightly Offtopic: Machine ethics and legislation

**Richards, Neil M. and Smart, William D**, *How Should the Law Think About Robots?* (May 10, 2013). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2263363 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2263363

- assesssing robot interaction frm a legislative perspective
- the imporatance of methaphors
- "At the concept stage, how we think about robots (and their human operators) will affect their design"
- "law almost always considers new technology as merely a new form of something else"
- The android fallacy. "Even in research labs, cameras are described as “eyes,” robots are “scared” of obstacles, and they need to “think” about what to do next." 
-acknowledges the point made by Darling that Social Robots should be treated differently not because they deserve it, but because of what it tells about us. ("Rather, it is a willful recognition of the biases of the general public and their propensity for falling prey to the Android Fallacy.")
