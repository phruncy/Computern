# Computern
A collection of all material related to the Computern master project.
## 
When J.C.R. Licklider proposed his *man-computer-symbiosis* in 1960, the relationship he frames appears like it is straight out of a contemporaneous romantic novel: The human acts, the computer reacts accordingly, human and machine work in intimate togetherness towards their mutual goal. The human leads and the machine is the perfact understanding, reliable, forward-thinking partner. However, J.C.R. Lickerlider did not mention the situation in which the protagonist desperatly types random lines into their command shell, trying to fix their blank-screen-camrea-not-working problem two minutes before an important video conference (f*ckin sh*t it has alsway worked before wy don't you now you ****** â€“ you get the gist). 

In reality, the work-related human computer relationship, most often rather a community of purpose, is prone to miscommunication, one-sided arguments and frustration. This misalignment is also heavily impended by the fact that one of the two coworkers is a lifeless object indifferent to the sufferings it causes the human subject. So, what's the carbon based, breathing partner with limited patience to do? This master project suggests a a strategy that has generally proven to be fruitful in a relationship: face the other with empathy.
