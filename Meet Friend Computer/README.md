# Meet Friend Computer

Earlier in the project, the creation of a character that leads through the exhibition was in discussion. It could be included in the form if *Freund Rechner (Friend computer)*, which is the actual name of my PC. Since humaniziing/ animalizing machinery is a major theme of this project, it would be wise to include an actual example.

This is Freund Rechner (minus the goggly eyes):
