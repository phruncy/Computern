While this project mainly revolves around the human-desktop-PC relationship in particular, A general search for the visual presentation of the human machine relationship is still worthwhile, leading to the realm of white humanoid robots standing next to businessmen in suits intently staring at holographic screens.

The inclined reader might want to recieve the following content specifically:
[A curated collection of stock photos of robot and human arms almost touchin each other, resembling Michelangelo's *Creation of Adam (Or the E.T. Poster, depending on your preference )*](https://www.istockphoto.com/de/collaboration/boards/NUTnhuqFXkqX3gjDgCvl7w)

*In the original painting, God reaches down to Adam, solidifying the roles of creator and creation.*
An analysis of the 49 collected images presents us with the following results:
- **15 images** show the human hand reaching down to the robotic arm, presenting humans as the machine's godly creators
- the originators of **15 images** were either undecisive or more concerned with symmetry, as both participants' hand are on equal heights
- The originators of a surprising **19 images** consider humanity doomed and have safely chosen to appease to our future humanoid robot overlords by rightfully putting them in the divine spot. 

Based on this, I would like to suggest a cute souvenir stand for technology trade shows:
